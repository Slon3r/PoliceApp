# Clearwatch UI/UX Specification

## 1. Overall UX Goals & Principles
**Core Design Principle:** "Professional Anarchy." The design must visually embody the defiant, rebellious, and empowered spirit of the movement, drawing from "hacker," "hip-hop," and "graffiti" elements. However, the aesthetic must never compromise the clarity, credibility, or accessibility of the data. Where style conflicts with readability, readability and usability will always win.
**Interactive and Engaging:** The interface will include thoughtful animations, interactive elements, and hidden "easter eggs" to make the platform a compelling and engaging space for the community.

## 2. Information Architecture (IA)
The site is organized around three core pillars: Database, Media, and Toolkit. A prominent "Submit Evidence" button is always visible as the primary call-to-action. The site also includes an About page and a user Account/Settings page.

## 3. User Flows
**AI-Assisted Evidence Submission:** The primary user flow is a conversational, interview-style process where an AI assistant guides the user through building their report, analyzing their evidence, and asking clarifying questions before a final user affirmation.
**Officer Research:** A clear, searchable flow allows users to find officers by name or badge number and view their complete public profile and associated incidents.

## 4. Wireframes & Mockups
**Primary Design Tool:** Figma.
**Homepage Layout:** The homepage will be a clean, focused landing page that establishes the brand and provides two primary actions: "Submit Evidence" or interact with the persistent AI Assistant chatbar at the bottom of the screen.

## 5. Component Library / Design System
A small, custom component library will be built to match the unique "Professional Anarchy" aesthetic. Core components include Buttons, Input Fields, Cards, and custom Map Pins.

## 6. Branding & Style Guide
**Visual Identity:** "Professional Anarchy" - a blend of a serious, credible, data-first presentation with a rebellious, stylized aesthetic.
**Color Palette:** A dark theme with a monochrome base and a vibrant cyan accent for interactive elements.
**Typography:** A clear font hierarchy using a bold, stylized font for headlines, Fira Code for tactical UI elements, and a clean sans-serif (Inter) for all body copy to ensure readability.

## 7. Accessibility Requirements
**Compliance Target:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
**Key Features:** The plan includes requirements for keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high color contrast, and a text-based, accessible fallback for the interactive map.

## 8. Responsiveness Strategy
A "mobile-first" approach will be used. The layout will be a single column on mobile and expand to a multi-column grid on larger screens. Navigation will collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile.

## 9. Animation & Micro-interactions
Motion design will be sharp and tactical, using subtle "glitch" and "terminal-style" effects for hover states and transitions, while respecting "prefers-reduced-motion" accessibility settings.

## 10. Performance Considerations
The site will adhere to Google's Core Web Vitals, with a target Largest Contentful Paint of under 2.5 seconds, achieved through modern web performance best practices like code splitting, image optimization, and efficient data caching.

## 11. Next Steps
The next step is to move into Figma to create high-fidelity mockups based on this specification and our mood board, followed by usability testing of the core flows.
