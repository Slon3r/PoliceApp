# Clearwatch Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context
**Goals**
[cite_start]Achieve Measurable Impact on Accountability by transforming systematic documentation into a high-cost activity for the police department and the city. [cite: 1575]
[cite_start]Transform Individual Incidents into Collective Action by providing a platform that makes it simple for a single citizen's evidence to become part of a larger, undeniable pattern of behavior. [cite: 1576]
[cite_start]Become the Definitive Source of Truth for journalists, legal professionals, and the public on police interactions in Clearwater, displacing the official narrative. [cite: 1577]
[cite_start]Shift the Public Narrative from Anecdote to Evidence by providing a constant stream of verifiable, data-driven content that is easy to share and understand. [cite: 1578]

**Background Context**
[cite_start]This document outlines the requirements for the Clearwatch application, a community-powered web platform designed to address systemic police harassment in Clearwater, Florida. [cite: 1579]
[cite_start]As detailed in the Project Brief, existing reform efforts are considered ineffective by the community, creating an urgent need for a new approach. [cite: 1580]
[cite_start]Clearwatch will function as an "Intelligence Hub," shifting the power dynamic by creating external, data-driven pressure on law enforcement. [cite: 1581]
[cite_start]By leveraging AI to analyze user-submitted evidence and automating the creation of detailed incident reports, the platform aims to make misconduct too inefficient to sustain. [cite: 1582]

## 2. Requirements
**Functional Requirements (FR)**
* [cite_start]FR1: Evidence Submission: The system shall allow users to submit evidence of police interactions, including video, images, and text descriptions. [cite: 1584]
* [cite_start]FR2: Tiered Submissions: The system shall support both "Verified" submissions (from registered users) and "Anonymous Tips" and shall distinguish between them on the platform. [cite: 1585]
* [cite_start]FR3: AI Analysis (Revised): The system shall use AI to assist in evidence analysis by automatically generating transcripts, tagging keywords, and identifying key objects (e.g., badge numbers) from video submissions. [cite: 1586]
* [cite_start]FR4: Public Database (Cop-Watch): The system shall maintain a public, searchable database of officers and incidents. [cite: 1587]
* [cite_start]FR5: Data Visualization: The system shall display incident data on an interactive map and in public-facing dashboards. [cite: 1588]
* [cite_start]FR6: Content Feeds: The system shall feature an AI-generated news feed and a user-submitted "Porkchop" feed. [cite: 1589]
* [cite_start]FR7: Content Creation: The system shall provide a public-facing AI-powered Meme Generator. [cite: 1590]
* [cite_start]FR8: Access Control: The system shall support "Anonymous Visitor" and "Registered User" roles with distinct submission capabilities. [cite: 1591]
* [cite_start]FR9: Activist Toolkit (Revised): The system shall provide a public-facing 'Activist Toolkit' page containing a downloadable pack of resources (e.g., printable assets, scripts, guides). [cite: 1592]
* [cite_start]FR10: Whistleblower Portal (Revised): The system shall provide a stand-alone, secure, and anonymous tip form for law enforcement that minimizes data storage. [cite: 1593]

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**
* NFR1: Security: The system must ensure the highest level of security, protecting user anonymity and submitted data. [cite_start]It must be architected to resist surveillance and de-anonymization attacks. [cite: 1594]
* NFR2: Performance: Public-facing pages must be fast and lightweight. [cite_start]Evidence submission and AI processing must be asynchronous. [cite: 1595]
* [cite_start]NFR3: Reliability: The platform must maintain high availability and be resilient to sudden spikes in traffic. [cite: 1596]
* [cite_start]NFR4: Usability: The evidence submission process must be extremely simple, intuitive, and empowering. [cite: 1597]
* [cite_start]NFR5: Verifiability: The system must visually and programmatically distinguish between data from "Verified Submissions" and "Anonymous Tips" to maintain credibility. [cite: 1598]
* [cite_start]NFR6: Scalability: The architecture must be able to scale to handle a large and growing volume of data and users. [cite: 1599]
* [cite_start]NFR7: Cost-Effectiveness: Technology choices must consider the project's community-funded nature, prioritizing scalable but cost-effective cloud services. [cite: 1600]

## 3. User Interface Design Goals
[cite_start]The platform will feature a single, unified user experience. [cite: 1601] [cite_start]The brand is serious, credible, and defiant. [cite: 1601] [cite_start]The UI must be clean, data-forward, and highly credible, presenting information like a trusted journalistic source. [cite: 1602] [cite_start]The feeling should be one of transparent authority, while incorporating a unique, rebellious "hip hop hacker" aesthetic in its typography and interactive elements. [cite: 1603]

## 4. Technical Assumptions
* [cite_start]**Repository Structure**: Monorepo. [cite: 1604]
* [cite_start]**Service Architecture**: Serverless Functions. [cite: 1604]
* [cite_start]**Testing Requirements**: Full Testing Pyramid. [cite: 1604]
* [cite_start]**Additional**: Security and user anonymity are the highest priority. [cite: 1605]

## 5. Revised Epic Plan
* [cite_start]Epic 1: Foundation & Core Intelligence Platform [cite: 1606]
* [cite_start]Epic 2: Public Empowerment & Engagement Tools [cite: 1606]
* [cite_start]Epic 3: The Ally Portal & Advanced Analytics [cite: 1606]

(Detailed story breakdowns for each epic follow in the full document) [cite_start][cite: 1606]

## 9. Checklist Results Report
* [cite_start]**Final Decision**: READY FOR ARCHITECT & UX-EXPERT [cite: 1606]

## 10. Next Steps
* [cite_start]**UX Expert Prompt**: Create the UI/UX Specification, focusing on the 'serious, credible, and defiant' public branding and the detailed user flows. [cite: 1607]
* [cite_start]**Architect Prompt**: Create the fullstack architecture document, adhering to the Monorepo, Serverless, and 'security-first' constraints. [cite: 1607]
