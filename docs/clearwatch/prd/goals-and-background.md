# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Achieve Measurable Impact on Accountability by transforming systematic documentation into a high-cost activity for the police department and the city.

Transform Individual Incidents into Collective Action by providing a platform that makes it simple for a single citizen's evidence to become part of a larger, undeniable pattern of behavior.

Become the Definitive Source of Truth for journalists, legal professionals, and the public on police interactions in Clearwater, displacing the official narrative.

Shift the Public Narrative from Anecdote to Evidence by providing a constant stream of verifiable, data-driven content that is easy to share and understand.

## Background Context

This document outlines the requirements for the Clearwatch application, a community-powered web platform designed to address systemic police harassment in Clearwater, Florida. As detailed in the Project Brief, existing reform efforts are considered ineffective by the community, creating an urgent need for a new approach.

Clearwatch will function as an "Intelligence Hub," shifting the power dynamic by creating external, data-driven pressure on law enforcement. By leveraging AI to analyze user-submitted evidence and automating the creation of detailed incident reports, the platform aims to make misconduct too inefficient to sustain.
