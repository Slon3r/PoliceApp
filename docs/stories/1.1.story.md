# Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup

## Status: Approved

## Story Statement
As a developer, I need the project foundation set up with the correct monorepo structure, development tools, and initial configurations so that we can begin building features in a consistent and maintainable way.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project is set up as a monorepo using pnpm workspaces
2. Frontend (Next.js) and backend (Supabase) projects are properly configured
3. Development environment can be started locally
4. Basic CI/CD pipeline is configured with GitHub Actions
5. All necessary development tools and CLIs are documented

## Dev Notes

### Technical Stack [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Framework: Next.js
- Backend Platform: Supabase
- Package Manager: pnpm
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions & Vercel

### Project Structure [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]
- Monorepo structure with separate apps for web frontend and API backend
- Shared packages directory for TypeScript types

### Development Setup [Source: architecture/11-development-deployment.md]
- Local development uses pnpm
- Supabase CLI required for local backend
- Automated deployment to Vercel (frontend) and Supabase (backend)

### High-Level Architecture [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- Serverless full-stack application
- Frontend: Next.js on Vercel
- Backend: Supabase services (Auth, Database, Storage) and Edge Functions

## Tasks / Subtasks

1. Initialize Monorepo Structure (AC: 1)
   - Create root package.json with pnpm workspace configuration
   - Set up apps/ directory for frontend and backend
   - Set up packages/ directory for shared code
   - Configure TypeScript for the workspace

2. Set up Frontend Project (AC: 2)
   - Initialize Next.js project in apps/web
   - Configure TypeScript and ESLint
   - Set up Tailwind CSS
   - Add basic environment variable configuration
   - Create placeholder pages for testing

3. Set up Backend Project (AC: 2)
   - Initialize Supabase project
   - Set up Edge Functions directory structure
   - Configure TypeScript for Edge Functions
   - Add basic environment variable configuration
   - Create test endpoint for verification

4. Configure Local Development Environment (AC: 3)
   - Install and configure Supabase CLI
   - Set up local development scripts in package.json
   - Create development documentation
   - Add environment variable templates

5. Set up CI/CD Pipeline (AC: 4)
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflow
   - Set up Vercel deployment
   - Configure Supabase deployment
   - Add deployment environment variables
   - Set up branch protection rules

6. Create Development Documentation (AC: 5)
   - Document repository structure
   - Add setup instructions
   - Document available commands
   - Create contribution guidelines
   - Add environment variable documentation

## Project Structure Notes
The project structure aligns with the architecture documentation. Key paths will be:
- /apps/web - Next.js frontend
- /apps/api - Supabase Edge Functions
- /packages/types - Shared TypeScript types
- /packages/config - Shared configurations

## Previous Story Insights
N/A - This is the first story.

## Notes for Dev Agent
- Focus on setting up a clean, maintainable foundation
- Ensure all configuration is properly typed
- Follow security best practices for environment variables
- Document each step clearly for future reference
